This tiny game may be played using a modern web browser.

## Controls
You may change from one lane to another by pressing 'w' to move to the next higher lane and 's' to move to the next lower lane.

To evade some obstacles you can jump using the space bar. Other obstacles may be passed by ducking under them using 'enter'.

## Known Bugs/Problems:
- we never tried out the game in Internet  Explorer or Edge, so no guarantee there
- Firefox has some weird problems when drawing on a HTML5 canvas; the obstacles on the road may be misplaced
